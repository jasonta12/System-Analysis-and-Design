# System-Analysis-and-Design
DriverPass System

Project Overview:
The DriverPass project involec designing a system for Liam - the owner of DriverPass, who needed a driving school management system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The systems features included accessing study materials, scheduling driving lessons, tracking student progress, managing payments or transactions and updating DMV compliance reports. 

What I Did Well:
 - Clearly defined the system requirements and user needs.
 - Designed Use Case diagrams and data flow models.
 - Ensured the system is scalable and intuitive.

Areas For Improvement:
Include further detail in the BRD on user journey explanations for key functions such as:
 - How Students schedule a lesson
 - How Instructors provie feedback
 - How Admins update training materials

Examples of improvements:
Instead of stating "students can schedule lessons", I would include:
 - Log in to the system
 - Navigate to scheduling
 - Select and instructor and available time slot
 - Confirm the booking and recieve a notification

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the client's requirements and ensuring they were refelected in my system design. I focused on designing a user-friendly, efficient, and scalable by including the following:
 - Role-based access to give appropriate permissions to students, instructors, secretaries, and administrators.
 - A cloud-based platform to allow users to access the system from any device.
 - Automated scheduling and notifications to make booking lessons and tracking progress seamless
 - Secure Payment Processing to let students purchase training packages with ease.
 - Activity logging and reporting to help admins track system usage and compliance.

I approach software design by first understanding the user's needs and buisness requirements, then translating those into structured, efficicent system that involves:
 - Requirement Analysis: Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders, and defining functional/nonfunctional specifications.
 - System Modeling: Create UML diagrams (use case, sequence, activity, and class diagrams) to visually plan out the system.
 - Architecture Design: Choose the best technology stack (cloud-based, web-based, database) for scalability and security.
 - Implementation Planning: Breaking the system into modular components for eacy developement.
 - Testing & iteration: Conduction unit testing, integration testing, and user feedback loops to refine the system (Agile Developement)
